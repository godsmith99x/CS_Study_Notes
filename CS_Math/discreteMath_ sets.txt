set - an unordered collection of different well defined objects
	usually represented by a single capital letter
	ex: set of all people in class taller than 1.7m
		H → {Rohan, Julia, Milloux}

element - each object in the set
	symbol ∈
	ex: Rohan is an element of set H
		Rohan ∈ H 
		
standard sets:
	N - set of all natural numbers
		numbers used for counting and ordering
		non-negative integers. some definitions begin with 0, some with 1
		1 → ∞
	W - set of all whole numbers
		natural numbers, including 0
		0 → ∞
	Z or I - set of all integers
		number that can be written without a fractional component
		-∞ → +∞
	Z+ - set of all positive integers
		0 → +∞
	Z- - set of all negative integers
		-∞ → 0
	Q - set of all rational numbers
		numbers that can be expressed as the quotient of two integers (p/q), a numerator p and non-zero denominator q
	R - set of all real numbers
		value of a continuous quantity that can represent a distance along a line, where points corresponding to integers are equally spaced
	C - set of all complex numbers
		number that can be expressed in form of a +bi, where a and b are real numbers and i represents an imaginary unit, satisfying the equation i^2 = -1
		
representing a set:
	roster method (tabular form) - elements separated by commas enclosed in curly brackets. no elements repeated
		ex: let V be a set of all vowels in english
		V = {a, e, i, o, u}
		let P be a set of all natural numbers less than 10
		P = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}
	
	set builder notation - elements represented by some common property. they are not listed like in roster
		notation: A = {x: p(x)} , where : is read as "such that"
		ex: let V be a set of all vowels in english
		V = {x: x is an english vowel}
		let P be a set of all natural numbers less than 10
		P = {x: x ∈ N and x < 10}
		
cardinality - total number of elements in that set
	notation - |S| , read as cardinality of set S	
	ex: let V be a set of all vowels in english
	|V| = 5
	B = {x: x ∈ W and x < 2} ∴ B = {0, 1}
	|B| = 2
	
types of sets:
	infinite
		cardinality is ∞
	finite
	empty (null) , { } = ∅
		cardinality is 0 ∴ a null set is a finite set
	singleton (unit) set - only one element , {s}
		ex: B = {x: x ∈ N, 9<x<11} ∴ B = {10}
		cardinality is always 1
	equal 
		elements are exactly the same
		notation =
	equivalent 
		cardinality is the same
		notation ~
	disjointed
		no common elements
	overlapping
		at least one common element
	subset
		X is a subset of Y if every element of X is an element of Y
		notation X ⊂ Y , read X is a subset of Y
		notation X ⊆ Y , read X is a subset of or equal to Y
		null ({ }) is a subset of every set 
		every set is a subset of itself
		equal sets are subsets of each other
	proper subset
		cardinality of subset is less than cardinality of set
	super set
		opposite of proper subset; i.e. the sets are not equal and the super set contains the whole subset plus additional elements
	power set
		set of all the subsets including the null set
		notation - P(A), where A is a set
		ex: for A = {a, b}
		P(A) = { {}, {a}, {b}, {a, b} }
		|A| = 2 , |P(A)| = 4 ∴ if |A| is n, |P(A)| = 2^n
		power set of a null set is still just a null set
	universal set
		in a particular problem, a set is universal if all the other sets in that problem are subsets of it



relationship between elements and subsets
	if 	a set has n elements, it will have 2^n subsets
	proper subsets = 2^n - 1 , bc every set is a subset of itself
	
union of sets
	set of elements that belong to the two sets being joined
	notation A∪B
	ex: A = {1, 2, 3} , B = {4, 5, 6}	
	A∪B = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}
	properties of union:
		commutative law - A∪B = B∪A
		associative law - A∪(B∪C) = (A∪B)∪C
		identity - A∪∅ = A
		idempotent law - A∪A = A
		universal - U∪A = U

intersection of sets
	set of elements common to both A and B
	notation A∩B
	ex: A = {1, 5, 6} , B = {2, 5, 6, 8}
	A∩B = {5, 6}
	properties of intersection
		commutative law - A∩B = B∩A
		associative law - A∩(B∩C) = (A∩B)∩C
		identity - A∩∅ = ∅
		idempotent law - A∩A = A
		universal - U∩A = A
		distributive - A∩(B∪C) = (A∩B) ∪ (A∩C)
			also - A∪(B∩C) = (A∪B) ∩ (A∪C)

set difference	
	if A and B are two sets, there difference is given by:
		A-B , which means elements of A that are not elements of B (unique to A)
		B-A , which means elements of B that are not elements of A (unique to B)

complement of a set
	if U is the universal set and A is its subset, then the complement of A is a set of those elements of U which are not in A
	notation A'
	A' = U-A 
	properties of complement sets
		complement of a universal set is a null set
		complement of a null set is a universal set
		the set and its complement are disjoint sets 
		A∪A' = A'∪A = U universal set
		A∩A' = ∅ bc they have nothing in common
		De Morgan's law A∪B = A'∩ B'
		De Morgan's law (A∩B)' = A'∪B'
		law of complementation (A')' = A 
		empty set law ∅' = U 
		U' = ∅

cartesian (cross) product
	set of all ordered pairs of all elements of two sets
	notation AxB
	ex: A = {1, 2} and B = {3, 4, 5}
	AxB = {(1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,3), (2,4), (2,5)}
	BxA = {(3,1), (3,2), (4,1), (4,2), (5,1), (5,2)}
	AxB ≠ BxA bc order matters in ordered pairs
