Command Pipelines
	standard input 0
	standard output 1
	standard error 2

	redirection > truncates file and then writes to it 
				>> does not truncate, just appends new data to destination 

	ex: cat 1> output.txt puts standard output of cat command to a file called output.txt
	you don't actually have to put 1 because standard output is default for redirection

	date > date.txt #redirects date from std out to file
	cut < date.txt --delimiter " " --fields 1 #cuts the first column of the date.txt file, each column separated by spaces

	pipe notation | 
	date | cut --delimiter=" " --field=1 > today.txt #pipes output of date command to input of cut command without having to write a file in between, then redirects to a new file 
	
	tee - used to shunt out data of a command pipeline
	date | tee fulldate.txt | cut --delimiter=" " --field=1

	xargs - lets you pipe into a command that only takes command line arguments, not standard input 
	if a command gives you an error that says 'missing operand', use xargs
	date | xargs echo 
	cat filestodelete.txt | xargs rm #cat reads the data saved in filestodelete.txt and passes each one as an standard input, then xargs converts them to command line arguments for rm, which removes files 

keyboard shortcuts
	ctrl c - cancels a running command
	ctrl l - clears terminal screen
		
aliases - nick names for pipe commands you have written and saved
	~/.bash_aliases
