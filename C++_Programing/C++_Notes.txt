Example: std::cout << "Hello World!\n";

	std::cout is the “character output stream”. It is pronounced “see-out”.
	
	<< is an operator that comes right after it.

	"Hello World!\n" is what’s being outputted here. You need double quotes 		around text. The \n is a special character that indicates a new line.

	; is a punctuation that tells the computer that you are at the end of a 		statement. It is similar to a period in a sentence.
