std::cout is the “character output stream”. It is pronounced “see-out”.
	
<< is an operator that comes right after it.

"Hello World!\n" is what’s being outputted here. You need double quotes around text. The \n is a special character that indicates a new line.

; is a punctuation that tells the computer that you are at the end of a statement. It is similar to a period in a sentence.

ex:
	#include <iostream>


	int main() {
		
		int favNum;
		
		std::cout << "Enter your favorite number between 0-100: " << std::endl;

		//takes input from user through the terminal
		std::cin >> favNum; 

		std::cout << "Wow! That's my favorite number too!" << std::endl;

		std::cout << "No, " << favNum << " really is my favorite." << std::endl;

		return 0;
	}
